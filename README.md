# README-Generator

For this project, I was tasked with creating a ReadMe Generator. My generator will give the user a list of questions and when the user answers all of them, they will get a generated ReadMe file. All the headers and content will be the appropriate size and the table of contents will have links to each header. Each header will have text underneath it which is the text the user typed in the generator. The license will have the badge and description next to it. The description will say what badge the application is using. The user can also give their Github username and email address for contact. The generated Readme files will be generated into the "ReadMe Files" folder which is inside the content folder. Inside that folder will contain all the generated ReadMe files. 

Partial Code provided by Instructor. Gitignore file located in the content folder, generateMarkdown mjs file located in utils folder, and package json and package lock json files located in the root directory.
